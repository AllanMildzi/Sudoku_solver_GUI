# Sudoku board generator using backtracking algorithm

This is a GUI implementation of the backtracking algorithm to both generate and solve a game of Sudoku.
The generation starts with an empty grid, then uses the algorithm to fully fill a valid sudoku grid, and finally, it randomly removes a certain number of digits from the grid depending on the difficulty chosen by the player.
